a)
The parameter to malloc is an integer value of size_t data type.
The max value a size_y will be 8Bytes, so 64 bits. So 2^64
At least in theory, 16EB, which is 16.384PB, which is 16 million TB!
2^64 = 18446744073709551616 = 0xffffffff ffffffff

b) 
Yes, always the same, the size_t is always the same.


c)
No, the calloc gets 2 parameters, both of type size_t.

First is the nuber of values and the other is the value data size.
Those numbers arre then multiplied and produce the final number aka the size of the memory.
In theory, it could be:
2^64 * 2^64 = 2^128
