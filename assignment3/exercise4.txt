b)
Our program gets killed.
We didn't free memory correctly after allocating matrices.

c)
We free the memory correctly:
// free matrices m and mt
    for(i=0;i<1000;i++){
      free(m[i]);
    }
    free(m);
    for(i=0;i<1000;i++){
      free(mt[i]);
    }
    free(mt);

Because it's a 2D matrix, in C, our original matrix is actually just an aray of pointers to our actual matrices.

The first pointer m is actually a pointer to a pointer of a first array.

exercise4.c now works.
