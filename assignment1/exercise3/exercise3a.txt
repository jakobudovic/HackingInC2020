/dev/random is blocking, whereas /dev/urandom is not.
That means that if/when /dev/random runs out of entropy, it blocks.
If we try to print out the urandom (cat command) we see it never stops, where as printing the random stops.

In Linux 4.8 and onward, /dev/urandom does not deplete the entropy pool (used by /dev/random) but uses the CSPRNG output from upstream.

The u in "urandom" means unlimited.
